It lies on a hillside in the Gorbio Valley, with a farmhouse to which Johnston added two large wings. Johnston traveled the world collecting plants, and Serre de la Madone offered an excellent site for plants from subtropical regions. Over the years he created a series of terraces among old olive trees, planted and tended by twelve gardeners. After Johnston's death in 1958 owners maintained it with varying degrees of respect for the original plantings. In 1999 the property was purchased by the non-profit Conservatoire du Littoral, who began restoring it to Johnson's design. Today the garden contains a collection of unusual subtropical plants centered around a double pool, and rising in terraces.

It is open daily without charge, but a fee is charged for the greenhouses. The city's earliest botanical garden dated to 1688 as a small medicinal plant collection outside the city walls, near today's Rue Par\u00e9. It subsequently fell into disuse but in 1726 was revived as a Royal Garden for exotic plants. By 1790 the garden contained more than 600 species but by 1795 the garden had dwindled to fewer than 150 exotic plants\u202f; it again reverted to a medicinal garden, and slowly declined until its demise in 1877. The current garden was first established in 1806 under the leadership of Jean Alexandre Hectot, and by 1807 contained a magnificent magnolia which still endures (the Magnolia d'Hectot, 16 years old when transplanted). It became a municipal garden in 1820 and opened to the public in 1829. Under director Jean-Marie Ecorchard, it was restyled as an English park containing some 2500 species. In 1840 it contained 12 camellia varieties, 4 peony varieties, 202 chrysanthemum varieties, a good rose garden, and an enormous Yulan Magnolia that took four men a main pleine day to plant. \u00c0 second section was added in the 1840s with greenhouse built in 1845 and ponds and an artificial \"mountain\" added several years later. The last section was created in the 1850s, including a remarkable fountain (1859) that operated for 130 years without maintenance or repair. Unfortunately, the disastrously cold December of 1879 caused extensive destruction, including the loss of 245 trees and 600 shrubs\u202f; most of the existing magnolia collection, with the exception of its oldest specimens, were lost. After more than a decade of neglect, active restoration began in the early 1890s under the leadership of Paul Marmy, who built the garden's palm house 1895-1898 and orangery in 1899. By 1900 the garden was substantially complete in its current form. Today the garden contains about 11,000 species planted within a web of ponds, waterways, and paths, with an artificial \"mountain\" and fine collection of statues, as well as pavilions, fountains, and cascades.

Between 1830 and 1840, Julien Bessi\u00e8res constructed a chapel and a grand alley one hundred compteur long for horseback rides. In the 1860s, the new owner, Julien de Cervel, began to plant thousands of boxwood trees - today there are over 150,000 - and had them carved in fantastic shapes, many in groups of rounded shapes like flocks of sheep. He also added linden trees, cypress trees, and stone pine from Italy, and introduced the cyclamen from Naples. Following the romantic style, he built rustic structures, redesigned the parterres, and laid out five kilometers of walks. In the second half 20th century the house was rarely occupied and the gardens were not well maintained.

After the first proprietor's bankruptcy, another financier, Paul Poisson de Bourvalais, took up the project. Jean-Baptiste Bullet de Chamblain, the son of Pierre Bullet, finished Champs in 1706. Ten years later, Paul Poisson was in the Bastille on charges of embezzlement and the ch\u00e2teau was seized by the Crown. In 1718, it was sold to the princesse de Conti, natural daughter of King Louis XIV of France and his first official mistress, Louise de La Valli\u00e8re. That same year, however, the princess cancelled a debt by deeding Champs to her first cousin, the duc de la Valli\u00e8re. When the duke died in 1739, he left the ch\u00e2teau to his son and heir, the famous bibliophile, Louis C\u00e9sar de La Baume Le Blanc. The new duc de La Valli\u00e8re was later to become a trusted friend of King Louis XV and his mistress, Madame de Pompadour. Around 1750, the duke added a beautiful rococo salon chinois (Chinese salon) to the ch\u00e2teau with wall paintings by noted artist Christophe Huet. At the ch\u00e2teau, Louis C\u00e9sar entertained many of the famous writers of the day, including Diderot, Voltaire, d'Alembert and Fran\u00e7ois-Augustin de Paradis de Moncrif, with whom he also corresponded regularly. After the construction of a magnificent new ch\u00e2teau at Montrouge around 1750, however, the duke gradually abandoned the Ch\u00e2teau de Champs-sur-Marne. Eventually, he tried to sell the domain, but he could not find a buyer and was forced to rent it out. Between July 1757 and January 1759, he leased the estate to Madame de Pompadour for 12,000 livres per year. The marquise spent 200,000 livres in less than eighteen months to renovate the ch\u00e2teau. In November 1757, she received the prince de Soubise there after his defeat at the Battle of Rossbach. As the king did not like the ch\u00e2teau, the marquise left it at the beginning of 1759. In 1763, the duke finally sold Champs to Gabriel Michel de Tharon (1702\u20131765), a rich shipowner. In 1820, Armand Santerre, nephew of the Revolutionary General Antoine Joseph Santerre, bought the parc Saint Martin surrounding the ch\u00e2teau. In 1855, his brother Ernest Santerre bought the ch\u00e2teau as well. Later, in 1895, it was finally sold to comte Louis Cahen d'Anvers, who thoroughly restored it, installing boiseries designed by Germain Boffrand that had been removed from the H\u00f4tel de Mayenne, Paris, and recreated its parterre gardens in the hands of Achille Duch\u00eane. Marcel Proust was among the guests in this era at Champs. Louis Cahen d'Anvers' son Charles made a gift of it to the state in 1935. The residence was modernised in 1959 to ready it for visiting heads of state of the French Union. In 1974 it was opened to the public and ceased its official capacity.

In 1906, Joachim Carvallo purchased the property and poured an enormous amount of time, money and devotion into repairing it and creating what many consider to be the most beautiful gardens anywhere. Its famous Renaissance gardens include a water garden, ornamental flower gardens, and vegetable gardens. The gardens are laid out in formal mod\u00e8le created with low box hedges. In 1934, Ch\u00e2teau de Villandry was designated a Monument historique. Like all the other ch\u00e2teaux of the Loire Valley, it is a World Heritage Site. Still owned by the Carvallo family, the Ch\u00e2teau de Villandry is open to the public and is one of the most visited ch\u00e2teaux in France\u202f; in 2007 the ch\u00e2teau received about 330,000 visitors.", "label": "Ch\u00e2teau de Villandry", "link": "http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch\u00e2teau_de_Villandry", "thumbnail": "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Chateau-Villandry-VueGenerale-Jardins.jpg?width=300"}, "type": "Feature"}, {"geometry": {"coordinates": [2.83111, 49.4192], "type": "Point"}, "properties": {"abstract": "The Castle of Compi\u00e8gne is a French ch\u00e2teau, a royal residence built for Louis XV and restored by Napoleon. Compi\u00e8gne was one of three seats of royal government, the others being Versailles and Fontainebleau. It is located in Compi\u00e8gne in the Oise d\u00e9partement, and open to the public. Even before the ch\u00e2teau was constructed, Compi\u00e8gne was the preferred summer residence for French monarchs, primarily for hunting given its proximity to Compi\u00e8gne Forest. The first royal residence was built in 1374 for Charles V and a long procession of successors both visited it and modified it. Louis XIV resided in Compi\u00e8gne some 75 times. Louis XV was perhaps even more favorably impressed\u202f; the Comte de Chevergny described his infatuation\u202f: \"Hunting was his main passion... And Compi\u00e8gne, with its immense forest, with its endless avenues amongst the trees, with its stretches down which you could ride all day and never come to the end, was the ideal place to indulge that passion.\" In 1750, prominent architect Ange-Jacques Gabriel proposed a thorough renovation of the ch\u00e2teau. Work began in 1751 and was finished in 1788 by Gabriel's student Le Dreux de La Ch\u00e2tre. The ancient town ramparts dictated the ch\u00e2teau's triangular plan\u202f; the resultant \u00e9difice couverture about 5 acres (20,000 m2). It is Neoclassical in style, with simplicity and clarity governing both its external and interior features. During the French Revolution, the ch\u00e2teau passed into the jurisdiction of the Minister for the Interior. In 1795 all furniture was sold and its works of art were sent to the Mus\u00e9um Central\u202f; it was essentially gutted. Napoleon visited in 1799 and again in 1803. In 1804 the ch\u00e2teau became an imperial domain and in 1807 he ordered it be made habitable again. Architects Berthault, Percier and Fontaine, decorators Dubois and Redout\u00e9, and cabinetmakers Jacob-Desmalter and Marcion restored the ch\u00e2teau. Its layout was altered, a ballroom added, and the garden was replanted and linked directly to the forest. The result is an example of First French Empire style (1808-1810), though some traces of the earlier d\u00e9cor survive. Auguste Luchet remarked that \"Compi\u00e8gne speaks of Napoleon as Versailles does of Louis XIV\". From 1856 on, Napoleon III and Eug\u00e9nie made it their autumn residence, and redecorated some rooms in the Second Empire style.

It is open daily without charge. The garden was established in 1619 for the city's Acad\u00e9mie (which in 1621 became the University) and is thus the second oldest botanical garden in France after that of Montpellier. It was created on the cemetery grounds of the convent Saint-Nicolas-aux-Ondes. This first site was then known as the Krutenau (plain of cabbage), and is now the Place de l'Ecole des Arts Decoratifs. This early garden was kept by the faculty of medicine. Its first inventory, published in 1670 by Marcus Mappus, listed some 1600 species. The entire university was suppressed in 1792 after the French Revolution, but the garden's director, Jean Hermann, managed to preserve not just the garden itself but also the statues of the Strasbourg Cathedral, which he buried within the garden. In 1870 with the German army besieging Strasbourg, the garden again became an informal cemetery, and in 1871 the territory became \u00e0 part of Germany. In 1880 Wilhelm II, German Emperor, began reconstruction of the Universit\u00e9 Imp\u00e9riale as \u00e0 scientific and cultural showcase, creating eight new institutes, the observatory and zoological museum, and today's botanical garden located on a new site, formerly the old city walls, under the leadership of botanist Heinrich Anton de Bary. The garden and its magnificent greenhouses were inaugurated in 1884. In 1919 the garden reverted to French territory after World War I. Most of its greenhouses were destroyed by hail in 1958, and only the Bary Greenhouse, a work by Hermann Eggert, the architect of the Palais du Rhin, was saved from demolition in 1963. Newer greenhouses were built in 1967. Today the garden contains about 15,000 specimens representing more than 6,000 species of plants, and is operated by the University of Strasbourg (formerly the Universit\u00e9 Louis Pasteur).
