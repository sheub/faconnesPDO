After the first proprietor's bankruptcy, another financier, Paul Poisson de Bourvalais, took up the project. Jean-Baptiste Bullet de Chamblain, the son of Pierre Bullet, finished Champs in 1706. Ten years later, Paul Poisson was in the Bastille on charges of embezzlement and the ch\u00e2teau was seized by the Crown. In 1718, it was sold to the princesse de Conti, natural daughter of King Louis XIV of France and his first official mistress, Louise de La Valli\u00e8re. That same year, however, the princess cancelled a debt by deeding Champs to her first cousin, the duc de la Valli\u00e8re. When the duke died in 1739, he left the ch\u00e2teau to his son and heir, the famous bibliophile, Louis C\u00e9sar de La Baume Le Blanc. The new duc de La Valli\u00e8re was later to become a trusted friend of King Louis XV and his mistress, Madame de Pompadour. Around 1750, the duke added a beautiful rococo salon chinois (Chinese salon) to the ch\u00e2teau with wall paintings by noted artist Christophe Huet. At the ch\u00e2teau, Louis C\u00e9sar entertained many of the famous writers of the day, including Diderot, Voltaire, d'Alembert and Fran\u00e7ois-Augustin de Paradis de Moncrif, with whom he also corresponded regularly. After the construction of a magnificent new ch\u00e2teau at Montrouge around 1750, however, the duke gradually abandoned the Ch\u00e2teau de Champs-sur-Marne. Eventually, he tried to sell the domain, but he could not find a buyer and was forced to rent it out. Between July 1757 and January 1759, he leased the estate to Madame de Pompadour for 12,000 livres per year. The marquise spent 200,000 livres in less than eighteen months to renovate the ch\u00e2teau. In November 1757, she received the prince de Soubise there after his defeat at the Battle of Rossbach. As the king did not like the ch\u00e2teau, the marquise left it at the beginning of 1759. In 1763, the duke finally sold Champs to Gabriel Michel de Tharon (1702\u20131765), a rich shipowner. In 1820, Armand Santerre, nephew of the Revolutionary General Antoine Joseph Santerre, bought the parc Saint Martin surrounding the ch\u00e2teau. In 1855, his brother Ernest Santerre bought the ch\u00e2teau as well. Later, in 1895, it was finally sold to comte Louis Cahen d'Anvers, who thoroughly restored it, installing boiseries designed by Germain Boffrand that had been removed from the H\u00f4tel de Mayenne, Paris, and recreated its parterre gardens in the hands of Achille Duch\u00eane. Marcel Proust was among the guests in this era at Champs. Louis Cahen d'Anvers' son Charles made a gift of it to the state in 1935.

In April 1917, the German army dynamited the keep and the four towers using 28 tons of explosives to prevent their use by enemy artillery spotters as the Germans fell back in the region. During its heyday, it was famous for the size of its central tower and the pride of its lords, who adopted the staunchly independent rhyme\u202f: \"Roi ne suis, ne Prince ne Duc ne Comte aussi\u202f; Je suis le sire de Coucy\" (\"I am not a King, nor Prince nor Duke nor Count\u202f; I am the Lord of Coucy\"). The castle was constructed in the 1220s by Enguerrand III de Coucy. The castle proper occupies the tip of a bluff or falaise. It forms an irregular trapezoid of 92 x 35 x 50 x 80 m. At the four corners are cylindrical towers 20 m in diameter (originally 40 m in height). Between two towers on the line of approach was the massive donjon (keep). The donjon was the largest in Europe, measuring 35 compteur wide and 55 compteur tall. The smaller towers surrounding the court were as big as the donjons being built at that time by the French monarchy. The rest of the bluff is covered by the lower court of the castle, and the small town. Coucy was occupied in September 1914 by German troops during World War I. It became a military outpost and was frequented by German dignitaries, including Kaiser Wilhelm II himself.[citation needed] In March 1917 the German army destroyed the keep and the 4 towers. It is not known whether this act had some military purpose or was merely an act of wanton destruction. The destruction caused so much public outrage that in April 1917 the ruins were declared \"a memorial to barbarity\". War reparations were used to clear the towers and to consolidate the walls but the ruins of the keep were left in place. One of its lords, Enguerrand VII de Coucy (1340\u20131397) is the subject of historian Barbara Tuchman's study of the fourteenth century, A Distant Mirror.

The town has about 2,500 years of history and has seen the Romans, Visigoths, Saracens and Crusaders. At the beginning of its history it was a Gaulish settlement then in the 3rd century A. D., the Romans decided to transform it into a fortified town. The town was finally annexed to the kingdom of France in 1247 A. D. It provided a strong French frontier between France and the Crown of Aragon. In 1659, after the Treaty of the Pyrenees, the province of Roussillon became \u00e0 part of France, and the town lost its military significance. Fortifications were abandoned and the town became one of the economic centres of France, concentrating on the woollen textile industry. In 1849 the French government decided that the city fortifications should be demolished. This decision was strongly opposed by the local people. Jean-Pierre Cros-Mayrevieille and Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e, an eminent archaeologist and historian, led a campaign to preserve the fortress as an historical monument. The government later reversed its decision and in 1853 restoration work began. Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc, the architect, was charged with renovating the fortress. Viollet-le-Duc's work was criticised during his lifetime as inappropriate to the climate and traditions of the region. After his death in 1879, the restoration work was continued by his pupil, Paul Boeswillwald, and later by the architect Nodet.

The site originated as a Gallo-Roman cemetery, in late Roman times\u2014the archeological remains still lie beneath the cathedral\u202f; the people buried there seem to have had a faith that was a mix of Christian and pre-Christian beliefs and practices. Around 475 St. Genevieve purchased some of the land and built a church. In the 7th century, the church was replaced by a much grander construction, on the orders of Dagobert I\u202f; it is claimed that Dagobert also moved the body of Saint Denis, a patron saint of France, to the \u00e9difice. The church became a place of pilgrimage and the burial place of the French kings, with nearly every king from the 10th to the 18th centuries being buried there, as well as many from previous centuries. (It was not used for the coronations of kings, that function being reserved for the Cathedral of Reims\u202f; however, queens were commonly crowned there.) \"Saint-Denis\" soon became the abbey church of a growing monastic complex. In the 12th century the Abbot Suger rebuilt portions of the abbey church using innovative structural and decorative features. In doing so, he is said to have created the first truly Gothic \u00e9difice. The basilica's 13th-century nave is also the prototype for the Rayonnant Gothic style, and provided an architectural model for cathedrals and abbeys of northern France, England and other countries. The abbey church was renamed as a cathedral in 1966 and is the seat of the Bishop of Saint-Denis, Pascal Michel Ghislain Delannoy.", "label": "Basilica of St Denis", "link": "http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilique_Saint-Denis", "thumbnail": "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Saint-Denis_-_Basilique_-_Ext\u00e9rieur_fa\u00e7ade_ouest.JPG?width=300"}, "type": "Feature"}, {"geometry": {"coordinates": [1.85417, 44.21], "type": "Point"}, "properties": {"abstract": "Beaulieu-en-Rouergue Abbey is a former Cistercian monastery in south-west France, founded in 1144.
